The problem lies in inconsistencies within the project's `build.gradle` files concerning the Android Gradle Plugin version. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Identify conflicting versions:** Examine your `android/build.gradle`, `android/app/build.gradle`, and possibly other `build.gradle` files within the Android subdirectory. Note any discrepancies in the `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:...'` line. 

2. **Ensure consistency:** Choose a compatible AGP version that aligns with Expo's current requirements.  Use a version supported by Expo's latest release, and update all occurrences of the `classpath` declaration.  You might need to consult Expo's documentation or search for the latest AGP version they support.

3. **Clean and rebuild:** After making the necessary updates to the Gradle files, execute a `expo prebuild` followed by a `expo run:android` command. The Gradle cache often causes problems. Make sure to perform a clean build using `./gradlew clean` before rebuilding the application.
